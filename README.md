# Django_coffeeshop

Personal project where I developed a website for a cafeteria using Python3 and the Django
framework. Currently, the project uses basic-middle features of Django. Please feel free to 
clone the repository and try it. Once the repository has been cloned, you will need to 
set up a virtual environment and download the following libraries:
 - Django
 - Pillow
 - pylint-django
 - django-ckeditor
